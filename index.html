<p>The Plugged In Church was a podcast dedicated to technical resources and solutions for small and under-resourced churches hosted by <a href="https://ericfrisch.com">Eric Frisch</a>, <a href="https://www.feikertcreative.com">Joshua Howey</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/DustyWallaceMus">Dusty Wallace</a>. We started the podcast in 2012 when we saw a need for better tech resources for churches with lower budgets. In our own roles as tech directors and worship leaders in small churches, we often found ourselves sharing our shoestring and DIY solutions with each other, and eventually decided to start recording those conversations.</p>
<p>After four great years and 123 episodes, we published our final show in December of 2016. Producing the podcast was a blast, and we'll always be thankful for the amazing guests and listeners who made the show what it was!</p>
<p>Feel free to check in on the hosts and our current endeavors by clicking on our names above. We'd love to hear from you! In the meantime, we leave you with our "Best of" episodes from 2014 and 2015, which represent some of our favorite work and are a great reminder of what The Plugged In Church was all about.</p>
<p>Power to your church!</p>
